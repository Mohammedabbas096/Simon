    <h1>How to Play Simon-Game</h1>
    <div class="container">
    <p>Simon Says is a fun game that helps in exercising listening skills and remebering. This game is fairly easy, but it can quickly turn into a challenge, especially if playing in a large group. Although this game goes by many names worldwide, the fun, basic rules tend to remain the same.
    <ol>
        The principle of the game is simple: the player have to memorize the series of illuminated keys and reproduce it. The purpose of the game is to reproduce the longest series of colors / sounds randomly generated by the Simon.
In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes increasingly difficult because the player's memory is more and more solicited.

<li> At the beginning of the game, one of the 4 keys lights up randomly producing simultaneously a sound associated to the key.</li> <br>
<li> The player has to press the same key.</li> <br>
<li> Next, the Simon turns back the same light on and a second one, again randomly.</li> <br>

<li> The player has to reproduce this chain of light using his memory.</li> <br>
<li> And so on... In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes all the more difficult as the player's memory is put to the test.</li> <br>
<li> If the player doesn't make any mistake, the game goes on, so it is an endless game!</li> <br>
    </ol> 
<h2>End of the Game</h2>
Repeat the number of sequences for Skill Levels 1,2, 3 or 4.... and if you press the wrong one the game will be end and will be restart from the level 1.
