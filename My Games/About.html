        <h3>How i made it:</h3>
        <p>In all the games i only used frontend (html,css,js) and made it possible by watching you-tube videos.</p>
        <p>For small queries and cheat code i used the following websites</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com" style="text-decoration: none; color: black;">W3Schools</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.educba.com" style="text-decoration: none; color: black;">Educba</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com" style="text-decoration: none; color: black;">Stack Over Flow</a></li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Snake-Game</h3>
        <p>In this game i used canvas as a board and declare the variables food,snake,velocity,cols,rows. The links which i used in this are googleapis and cloud fare for the symbols on side bar. Making this game was really fun for me and hope you to enjoyed it while playing.</p>
        <h3>Simon-Game</h3>
        <p>I learnt this Game from online teaching platform (Udemy). As a beginner i faced big issues in making this game. It was a big challenge for me to play the sounds  while the buttons get clicked and to hover the buttons at the same time. Hope you enjoyed this game if you don't know how to play go to "Simon-Game" through short-cut from side bar and then click on the button "How to Play" from the side bar available there. </p>
        <h3>Breakout</h3>
        <p>Hope you enjoyed this game very well.It was really fun making such type of games. In this game is also used canvas as board for the playing back-ground. 
        The variables i declared in this are player,block,ball,velocity,rows,cols etc... Animation is also used in this game and it has many levels as you play furtherly. </p>
